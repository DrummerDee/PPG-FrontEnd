## What was learned 
Besides learning more details about my favorite characters, I revisted how to fetch data from an API. In this case, the api is one that I created on the server side. I learned to format my code more efficiently so that other programmers, and myself, can easily read what I'm accomplsihing. Lastly, I learned to use my developer tools more which helped me to correct my application's mobile responsiveness and accessability.
